# Resource Collection Hub

### Priority Todo

- Make note cards smaller, and have them side by side, since the content inside doesn't justify full width of page.
- Add Firebase as a data storage for all resources that are added.
- Sync container with resources already existing in our firebase database.

#### Future Implements

- Add note property "comments", so that user can comment what the resource is good for, and why he or she suggested it
- Add note property "category", so that later we can have folders and filter the resources posted.
