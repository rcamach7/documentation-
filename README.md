# Resource Collection Hub

### Priority Todo

- Add an exit button on the add resource form - incase we want to cancel. Right now we get stuck on that section.
- Add a delete button where we are able to delete a resource.
- Add an edit button - where we are able to edit a resource.
- Sync container with resources already existing in our firebase database.

#### Future Implements

- Add note property "category", so that later we can have folders and filter the resources posted.
